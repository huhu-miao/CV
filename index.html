     the player gets one point and enters to the next level where all the cars speed up a little bit.</p>
  <p><em>U.S States Game</em>: A learning tool for all the people who love geography. The player enters
     the name of the states in the U.S in the prompt window, it will show on the map if it does exist.
      When the player want to exits the game, a csv file will be generated to show the

  <p><b>Java:</b></p>
  <p><em>BarCharterRacer</em>Produce animated bar charts showing any given data
    changes over a period of time. The length of the bar shows the relevant data
    number, which grows when the data grow and ranks dynamically with the highest on the top. </p>
  <p><em>Huntington’s Disease Detecto</em>: Analyze a DNA string for Huntington’s
     disease and produce a diagnosis. Read the genetic sequence from the file and
     count the number of CAG repeats.</p>
  <p><em>Kernel filter</em>: An image-processing program that applies various 
    kernel filters to images, such as Gaussian blur, sharpen, Laplacian, emboss,
    and motion blur. A kernel filter modifies the pixels in an image by replacing
    each pixel with a linear combination of its neighboring pixels. </p>
